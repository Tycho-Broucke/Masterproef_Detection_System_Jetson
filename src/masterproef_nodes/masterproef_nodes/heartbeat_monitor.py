# JETSON NODE
#
# this code runs a node that keeps track of the messages received by the heartbeat publisher
# once it does not receive anymore messages, the connection is considered as lost
# it then gives an error, but this error still has to be handled (emergency stop should be performed)
#
# the log statements that will be called in each iteration are commented out to keep the memory from filling up
